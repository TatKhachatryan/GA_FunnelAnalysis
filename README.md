# GA_FunnelAnalysis
Funnel Analysis on Google Analytics Sample Data

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project uses Google Analytics session data from BigQuery's public dataset GA_Sessions_Demo to perform a funnel analysis across key ecommerce steps:

Landing Page â†’ Product Page â†’ Cart â†’ Checkout â†’ Thank You

With over 10,000 sessions, this dataset offers a rich opportunity to identify conversion drop-offs, assess user behavior by segment, and suggest UX and technical improvements based on actual funnel performance.

âœ… Mapped a 5-step ecommerce funnel across 10K+ GA sessions
âœ… Identified drop-offs by segment: device, country, browser
âœ… Created actionable insights for product, UX, and data teams
âœ… Built two funnel models: Standard and Fast-Track
âœ… Used BigQuery + Colab for data processing and Plotly for visualization.
